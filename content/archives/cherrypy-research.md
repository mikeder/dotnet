#### Cherrypy research

Spent some time last night reading the Cherrypy docs and API. I'm trying to get
a firm grasp on the web framework so I can better understand the changes I want
to make to CherryMusic and so going forward with the tools I build I can
incooporate them into a nice web interface. Cherrypy doesn't force you to use a
certain structure in new projects and like almost everything else in
programming there are multiple ways to do what you want to do. My struggle
right now is understanding the subject enough so as not to program myself into
a corner and have an application that can't be expanded easily. In my research
I found a project on BitBucket called
[Twiseless.](https://bitbucket.org/Lawouach/twiseless/src "Twiseless") It seems
like a good starting point for understanding how the various parts of Cherrypy
*can* work together. I like the structure of it anyway so I think going forward
I will try to setup my projects in a similar fashion. First on my list of
projects is a tool set for use at work, random string generator, account
creation tool, etc. Once I have this in place and working to a fair degree I
will turn my focus to CherryMusic. I have gotten some good feedback from the CM
devs on how to implement new database objects and together with learning the
ins and outs of Cherrypy I hope to be able to contribute to their project in the
near future.
