#### Swapping Windows 7 for Xubuntu

For the past few days my home PC has been giving me problems in Windows.
Complaining about Windows Security Essentials being turned off and I couldn't
get it to turn back on. I said fuck it, Windows has been giving me nothing but
trouble lately. I have no reason to not go to Linux full time at home. Most of
my gaming is done on the PS4 now and the few PC games that I do play are
available on Linux. So I wiped my SSD and installed Xubuntu, here I am finally
making a log update from a terminal window directly from my main PC. It's nice
to not have to SSH into a box first and then edit this log.
