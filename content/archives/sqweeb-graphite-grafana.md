# SqweebNet + Graphite + Grafana

- [X] Update sqweeb.net

I spent most of the day yesterday setting up a few new things on the sqweeb.net
servers, specifically Graphite and Grafana. I started with a new Ubuntu VM,
updated it, install the short stack (open-vm-tools, vim, git, htop), install
the extend stack (python-pip, python-dev, build-essentials). I think I'd rather
continue this in a wordpress post, over at > [http://sqweeb.net](http://sqweeb.net)
