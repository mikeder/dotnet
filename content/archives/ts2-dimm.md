- [x] Replace bad DIMM in TS2 (Bank 2 DIMM A)

I ended up just removing the bad DIMM from TS2 but at the moment it looks like
it doesn't want to boot up like that. Ill have to hook up a monitor tomorrow
and see what the deal is.

Tidying up my work spaces a bit. I need some movement in these areas from time
to time maybe just to get some new perspective or just an excuse to work at a
mindless task. I don't really know. I put the servers on their own shelves on a
wire rack today. They all sit in an open closet but they may get moved
again as I think its louder where they are now. I made a little bit of progress
on upgrading my MPC4000. I set out to put an SSD in it to get rid of the noise
old 60GB IDE drive in there. So far I haven't had any luck getting the MPC to
recognize the IDE -> SATA convertor adapter. I need to determine if the second
IDE connector on the MPC CPU board is usable or if I'm stuck using the
connector underneath the audio board.
