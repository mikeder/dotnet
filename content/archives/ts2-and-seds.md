# TS2 and Space Engineers

I opened up TS2 to add some extra RAM that I had laying around. This brings the
grand total to 7GB! Not really anything to brag about but any little bit helps
I guess. I also got it all updated as well as got Space Engineers to the latest
version. The update to Space Engineers last week enabled worlds with a max of
100,000km and procedural asteroids that allow for tons more shit to run into.
Just wanted to make note of these things for some reason. Not really an
important update.

# CherryMusic Development

I am going to start working on some contributions to the CherryMusic project.
One of the dev's responded to a tread I started on the project page about
adding a few features and he gave me some great info on where to start. I'm
going to start poking around and see if I can't figure out how to add a few
neat features. They are features that I had grown to like when using Winamp and
seem should be part of any music player in some way shape or form.

1. Ability to queue songs within the playlist and a queue reset button.
2. Metadata stored in a db for quicker access.
3. Playlist generator options (certain albums, artists, etc.)
