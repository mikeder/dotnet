The TTSHv4 is the latest revision of an ARP2600 clone originally produced by TheHumanComparator, now sold
by SynthCube. I decided to purchase 2 of their full kits when they were made available for pre-order and
 I'm now closing in on the end of the 2nd build. 

This is a collection of thoughts and pictures about the build process of this amazing synthesizer.
