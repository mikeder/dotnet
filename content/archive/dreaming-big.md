#### Dreaming big in CherryPy and Mako

I have all these thoughts and ideas streaming through my head since playing
with [Cherrypy][5] this weekend. I am still very much a novice in all aspects of
programming and development but I can't deny my urge to write apps for
everything I imagine. I figured I should probably try and write some of them
down for organizational purposes even if I do never get to most of them.
These apps will provide user friendly front ends to mine and others python
projects through a templating system called [Mako.][6] With Mako I can make
html templates that include some python references to get generated on the
client based on user inputs and requests.

* RaspberryPi weather, dht and thermostat apps
* rsdc music scraper app (scheduling, source selection, manual grabs)
* electric sheep type visualizer app (graphics probably beyond me)
* bill tracker/reminder app
  * (already exists with Mint and the like but still good to learn.)
* centralized link hub (bookmarks, home automation, etc.)

I think what attracts me most to the idea of developing web apps in Python +
CherryPy is how platform independant that will make them. Everyone has access
to a web browser, without even having to install anything on any current device
you can easily access the internet. Because of this web apps of this fashion
will never be limited to the crowd willing to download apps from some other
store or hub. All that would be required is knowing the url to the app and
you're ready to start using it.

In addition to these new ideas I still want to dig more through the CherryMusic
code. I'm starting to understand how the pieces fit together a little bit
better now. Reading through the CherryPy docs was initially so that I could
understand the CM server better so I suppose I should stay focused on that for
now. I do want to add to my ides for that the ability to change to a darker
theme within the CM user options page. I know now how to edit those templates
for the UI part but updating or overriding CSS is still a little over my head.
This would have to be session dependent or at least a userDB option or
something. Like I said, still much to learn when it comes to all this stuff. By
the time this is all done and I decide whether or not I can be a programmer
worth a damn, I think I'm going to need glasses. So much text to consume and
code to write!
